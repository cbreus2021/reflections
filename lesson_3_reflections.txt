When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you wanted to share your work with other poeple or be able to access your work off of your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If there's a bug in the code on your desktop, you don't want Git to automatically update a get that bug. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches add changes in the same repository, while forking and cloning can move to different repositories. Forking revolves more around GitHub than cloning. I would use branches if I wanted access to a different version of the code, clononing if I wanted to work on something locally, and forking if I wanted to work on something publicly.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You don't need wifi to access/change your code

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would use Google Docs and then copy and paste it into my local repository. It would be easier in the sense of collaborating, but actually applying the code outside of Google Docs would be a lot more difficult

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I would never want to make a change in master until I'm sure that my code is perfect, so I especially won't work with master if I have a partner until I;m sure that both of our changes would work.
